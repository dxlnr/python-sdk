Python SDK library for using the **Modalic Federated Learning Operations Platform**.

The SDK library serves as convenient interface for performing Federated Learning with the most common Machine Learning frameworks like [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) or [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) written in the Python programming language.
As an additional software layer within a Machine Learning pipeline, the SKD enables an individual client application to take part within a Federated Learning setup.
The coordination of a distributed Machine Learning process solving a particular problem, is done by a central server or service provider which can be started via Python script using the SDK.

As the main entrypoint to a production ready FLOps Platform, this software package aims for all developers and ML practitioners that want to run ML use cases in distributed fashion.

## Usage
In order to run a Federated Learning procedure two main entities have to instantiated. The client logic and the aggregation server application.
Both can be started via the SDK. Currently Pytorch \& Tensorflow are supported as framework to construct the ML architecture.

#### Run the Aggregation Server

```python
# (1) Run the aggregation server with configuration using .toml
cfg = toml.load("${configPATH}.toml")
modalic.run_server(cfg)
```
The *.toml* file can be used to control hyperparameters for the aggregation server.
```toml
# -c configs/config.toml

# REST API settings.
[api]
# The address to which the REST API of the server
# will be bound. All requests should be sent to this address.
server_address = "127.0.0.1:8080"

# Hyperparameter controlling the Federated Learning training process.
[protocol]
# Defines the number of training rounds (global epochs) 
# that will be performed.
training_rounds = 10
# Sets the number of participants & local models 
# one global epoch should at least contain.
participants = 2
```

For implementing the client logic a framework of choice can be used.

#### Pytorch

```python
# (2) Construct the client logic.
import modalic

# Define a FLClient object that implements all the ML logic and will
# used as an input to an internal modalic client which enables the 
# program to connect to the server an perform training in distributed fashion.
class FLClient(modalic.Client):

  def __init__(self, dataset, ...):
    self.model = Net()
    self.dataset = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)
    ...

  def train(self):
    for epoch in range(0, self.epochs):
        for images, labels in self.trainloader:
            ...

    return self.model

  def serialize_local_model(self, model):
      return modalic.serialize_torch_model(model)

  def deserialize_global_model(self, global_model):
      self.model = modalic.deserialize_torch_model(
          self.model, global_model, self._get_model_shape()
      )

  def get_model_shape(self):
      return modalic.get_torch_model_shape(self.model)

  def get_model_dtype(self):
      ...

# Construct the client layer..
client = FLClient(...)

# (3) Run training for single client.
modalic.run_client(client)
```

#### Tensorflow

```python
# (2) Construct the client logic.

class FLClient(modalic.Client):

  def __init__(self, dataset, ...):
    # Initialize & compile the MobileNetV2 model.
    self.model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2((32, 32, 3), classes=10, weights=None)
    # Load the CIFAR-10 dataset using tf.keras.
    (self.x_train, self.y_train), (_, _) = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()
    ...

  def train(self):
    ...
    self.model.fit(self.x_train, self.y_train, batch_size=self.batch_size, epochs=self.epochs)
    ...
    return self.model

  def serialize_local_model(self, model):
      return modalic.serialize_tf_keras_model(model)

  def deserialize_global_model(self, global_model):
      self.model = modalic.deserialize_tf_keras_model(
          self.model, global_model, self._get_model_shape()
      )

  def get_model_shape(self):
      return modalic.get_tf_keras_model_shape(self.model)

  def get_model_dtype(self):
      ...

# Construct the client layer..
client = FLClient(...)

# (3) Run training for single client.
modalic.run_client(client)
```
