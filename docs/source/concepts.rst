Federated Learning
------------------

*Federated learning is a machine learning setting where multiple entities (clients) collaborate
in solving a machine learning problem, under the coordination of a central server or service
provider. Each clientâ€™s raw data is stored locally and not exchanged or transferred; instead,
focused updates intended for immediate aggregation are used to achieve the learning objective.*
